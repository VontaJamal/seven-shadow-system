# Site Soul Brief

Quick positioning guide for dashboard UI/UX tone and interaction priorities.

- brand_personality: disciplined, sovereign, maintainers-first
- audience: maintainers triaging high-volume pull request and notification queues
- tone: direct, tactical, confidence-building
- visual_non_negotiables: high contrast, deterministic status language, dense signal clarity, no color-only meaning
- interaction_style: fast triage loops, low-friction drill down, explicit degraded-state feedback
- anti_goals: decorative-only motion, hidden critical risk, vague system status, novelty-first UI decisions

# Shadow Gate Design Preflight

## Applied Principles

- Deterministic status language over decorative wording.
- Non-color status signaling (`[PASS]`, `[WARN]`, `[BLOCK]`) in every output mode.
- Remediation attached directly to each finding.
- Stage progression remains explicit and understandable (`whisper`, `oath`, `throne`).

## Site Soul Alignment

- Maintainers-first triage output: high signal, low ambiguity.
- Direct tactical tone with explicit state and next action.
- Dense but structured CLI sections designed for rapid scanning.

## Animation Audit Summary

- CLI touchpoints: no animation introduced.
- Dashboard touchpoints: unchanged in this pass.
- Keep decision: avoid decorative-only motion for governance-critical output.

## AI Intent Map

- Intent: improve review trust by making shadow doctrine enforceable and explainable.
- Mechanism: stage-aware deterministic findings + per-domain rationale.
- Human control: temporary exceptions are explicit, time-bound, and reported.
- Safety: fail-safe runtime findings block on critical security/runtime integrity failures.

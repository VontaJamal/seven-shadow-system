## Mission
Ship Seven Shadow System as an open, composable, submodule-first governance system for AI review quality and trust.

## Quality Bar
- Default policy must be deterministic and auditable.
- Runtime checks must fail safe under malformed input.
- Submodule wiring must be repeatable and idempotent.
- CI must pass on pull requests before merge.

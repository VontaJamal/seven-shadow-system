# BUILD SPEC: Civ Mode (Deprecated Alias)

This document is retained as a compatibility pointer.

## Canonical Spec

Use:

- `BUILD-SPEC-CIVILIAN-MODE.md`

That file is the single source of truth for civilian-mode behavior, terminology mapping, and implementation expectations.

## Notes

- Historical references to "civ mode" map directly to "civilian mode".
- Do not maintain parallel requirements in this file.
